AssetReturns_Behavior
==================

Most financial markets studies involve returns of assets, instead of prices. There are several definitions of an asset return. Here is analyzed statistically the lognormal returns of different Stock indexes. Also, the Ibovespa Index is replicated using the returns of the assets that compose it. This assignment was done as part of the Master in [Quantitative Finance ](http://eesp.fgv.br/ensino/mestrado-profissional/economia/area-financas-quantitativas) course, at the [FGV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundação_Getúlio_Vargas) University. You can check my report <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> (the text is in Portuguese). I will use mostly Python to code the project.
